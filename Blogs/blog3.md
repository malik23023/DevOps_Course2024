# Zero-Trust Workloads in Kubernetes with Cosign and Kyverno (Ubuntu Setup)

## Summary

In this blog, we explore how to implement a **Zero-Trust Security Model** for Kubernetes workloads using **Cosign** and **Kyverno** on an **Ubuntu** setup. The blog covers the step-by-step process for signing container images with Cosign, enforcing image signing policies with Kyverno, and deploying signed images in a Kubernetes cluster. This approach ensures that only trusted images are deployed, significantly enhancing the security of your Kubernetes environment. 

We also dive into the automation of this workflow using **GitHub Actions**, streamlining the build, sign, and deployment process. The setup is simple yet effective for securing Kubernetes workloads, and the blog provides a comprehensive guide on how to achieve this.
