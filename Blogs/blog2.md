# Kubernetes Pods - K8s Series

## Introduction
This blog provides a detailed exploration of Kubernetes Pods, explaining their core role in Kubernetes as the smallest deployable units. It highlights their functionality, architecture, and how Pods work in a Kubernetes environment, with a focus on deploying and managing Pods using `kubectl` and Minikube.

## Key Takeaways

1. **What are Kubernetes Pods?**  
   Kubernetes Pods are collections of one or more containers, deployed together on the same node. Pods enable tight coupling of application components with shared networking and storage, making them ideal for handling microservices in Kubernetes.

2. **How Pods Differ from Docker Containers:**  
   While Docker containers are isolated and standalone, Kubernetes Pods provide a more flexible environment by allowing multiple containers to share resources like networking and storage, optimizing resource management and scaling.

3. **Pod Deployment Using YAML Manifests:**  
   Pods are defined using YAML manifests, specifying container configurations, such as the image, ports, and resource requirements. The blog shows a sample YAML file for deploying an NGINX container in a Pod.

4. **Managing Pods with kubectl:**  
   The blog walks through common `kubectl` commands for creating, inspecting, and deleting Pods, such as `kubectl create -f pod.yml`, `kubectl get pods`, and `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.
